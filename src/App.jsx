ðŸ’ª Exercise: Using Context

The fruit market now has a cart feature. All the fruits in your cart are displayed within the <CartList> component, which accesses the items in the cart via CartContext, which has been set up in src/context/cart-context.js.

CartProvider provides two values:
  - itemsInCart (an array)
  - addToCart (a function)

The "Add to cart" buttons are currently not working.

ðŸŽ¯ Your task:
- Explore the context setup in these three files:
  - src/App.jsx
  - src/context/cart-context.js
  - src/components/CartList.jsx
- Now look at src/components/ItemCard.jsx.
  - Make the "Add to cart" buttons function as expected.

ðŸ’¡ Tip:
- You only need to update the src/components/ItemCard.jsx component.
- use the useContext hook to consume CartContext so that you can access the addToCart function.
